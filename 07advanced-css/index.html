            <p>The Rocky Mountain fisheries primarily cover the region of the <a href="lakes.html">Rocky Mountains</a> in North America, which extends from <em>British Columbia and Alberta in Canada down through Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, and into northern Mexico.</em> This expansive and diverse region is home to a wide variety of rivers, streams, lakes, and reservoirs that support a rich and varied fishery. Each state or province within this region may have its own specific regulations, fishing seasons, and species of fish that anglers target, but collectively, the Rocky Mountain fisheries offer some of the most sought-after fly fishing and angling opportunities in North America. .</p>
